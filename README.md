repo for publicizing academic projects

## This is a place-holder repo for multiple academic projects that cannot be publicly posted due to plagarism concerns. 
Below are descriptions of the projects, code can be provided upon request. 


## Excellent Animator 
Java project to animate text documents in Java Swing. Offers options for animation in SVG format, formatted text, and an editable animation panel with the ability to insert and delete keyframes of the animation.

## Picture Shrinker
Java project to progressively shrink a photo by cutting out the "least interesting" seam of pixels. Has options for shrinking solely in the horizontal or vertical directions, changing the view to reflect how interesting the seams are, and putting the pixels back to enlarge the photo to its original size. The seams are found and removed using graph theory concepts. 

## Maze Generator and Solver
Java project that generates a complex maze with a single path from start to finish using Dijkstra's algorithm. Allows the user to attempt to solve the maze, has an option to auto-solve the maze with both BFS and DFS search. 

## Centipede 
Java game resembling the classic Atari game including a player that can shoot darts and water baloons at a moving centipede and re-arrangable (and random generated) obstacles. The centipede splits into pieces when shot, all continuing to move toward the player. Once the centipede is deleted a new level starts with a longer and faster bug, the score is kept and th egame ends once the player dies. 

## Recognizing Handwritten Numbers with Machine Learning
Racket program that compares handwritten numbers to a existing database of numbers to figure out which digit is in the photo. Using Machine Learning techniques of regression the program is able to recognize all forms of user uploaded numbers.
